# ACW1.0_Steganography

## What is Steganography?
> Steganography is the practice of concealing a message within another message or a physical object. In computing/electronic contexts, a computer file, message, image, or video is concealed within another file, message, image, or video.

Basically, Steganography allows you to hide any type of message or data within another file without the file changing completely. You could hide an excel sheet within an image file and no one will be able to tell there is a hidden excel file in said image.

## 1. Program Overview 
This is a Steganography program that enables users to hide their data within different file types and vice versa. The program utilises the LSB Replacement algorithm and users are able to customize the number of bits they would like to use to hide their data (1-8 bits). Users are able to encode and decode their files with their respective bits selection. 

## 2. Encoding 
Users are able to encode any file type whether it is an audio, video, image, text, excel, document, into any of the following file types:
